# Smart AI Assistant

## Overview
This project implements a simple **AI-powered assistant** that interacts with users through a command-line or script-based interface. The assistant processes user input and generates responses using predefined logic and external AI services where applicable.

The project demonstrates how to structure an AI assistant application in Python, focusing on interaction flow and response handling.
